  <h1>Privacy Policy for Wikitter iOS App</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 28, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>Wikitter</strong>, an iOS app that delivers random Wikipedia facts in a simple, social-style feed. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and your rights under applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Wikitter does <strong>not collect personally identifiable information</strong> such as your name, email address, or contact information. However, we may collect limited usage data for performance and analytics purposes.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Firebase Analytics) to collect anonymous usage data. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and model</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Interaction events (e.g., app opens, feature usage)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data helps us improve the app and user experience. It is aggregated and does not directly identify individuals.</p>

  <h2>3. Crash Reporting</h2>
  <p>Wikitter uses crash reporting tools (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics) to identify bugs and crashes. The data may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crash logs and stack traces</li>
    <li>Device state at time of crash</li>
    <li>Operating system and app version</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used solely to improve app stability and is not linked to any personal identifiers.</p>

  <h2>4. Use of Wikipedia API</h2>
  <p>The app retrieves content from the publicly available <strong>Wikipedia API</strong>. These requests are made directly from your device to Wikipedia’s servers. No user data is shared with Wikipedia through these requests.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights Under GDPR (EU Residents)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights under the GDPR:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access the data we collect about you</li>
    <li>The right to request correction or deletion of your data</li>
    <li>The right to object to or restrict data processing</li>
    <li>The right to data portability</li>
    <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information below.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights Under CCPA (California Residents)</h2>
  <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the following rights under the CCPA:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to know what personal information we collect and how it’s used</li>
    <li>The right to request deletion of your personal information</li>
    <li>The right to opt out of the sale of personal information (note: Wikitter does not sell your data)</li>
    <li>The right to non-discrimination for exercising your privacy rights</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To request access to or deletion of your personal data, please contact us.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain usage and crash data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as required by law.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Wikitter is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us for deletion.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard practices and trusted third-party tools to secure any collected data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we strive to protect your data responsibly.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here, and we encourage you to review this page periodically for changes.</p>
